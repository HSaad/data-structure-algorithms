## Binary Trees

Binary search trees-data items that are turned into a tree full of nodes, where each left node is "lower" than each right node. The tree starts with the "root node" and any node with no children is called a "leaf node".

A method #breadth_first_search which takes a target value and returns the node at which it is located using the breadth first search technique. If the target node value is not located, nil is returned.

A method #depth_first_search which returns tha node at which the target value is located using the depth first search technique.

A method #dfs_rec, which runs a depth first search recursively. Does not use a stack.

## Knight's Travails

A functions #knight_moves that shows the simplest possible way to get form one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.
